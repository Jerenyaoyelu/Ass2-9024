# This is a repository for the assignment of course COMP9024 --- Data Structure and Algorithms.
- This assignment is asking us to implement a AVL tree and its basic functions such as insertion, deletion, etc.
- Highlights:
    1. Implemented right rotation(O(1)) and left rotation(O(1)) to achieve single and double rotation(O(log(n))).
    2. Used stacking iterate AVLTree and generate an optimized Union tree of two given trees(O((m+n)log(m+n))).
    3. Used silding window to iterate two arrays at the same time to generate the intersected elements, by which, an intersection of two given trees(O(m+n+klog(k))) is successfully generated .
- For any further specific requirements, please read the assignment2.pdf carefully.
